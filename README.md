## What is Argo Events?

**Argo Events** is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. It allows you to trigger 10 different
actions (such as the creation of Kubernetes objects, invoke workflows or serverless workloads) on over 20 different
events (such as webhook, S3 drop, cron schedule, messaging queues - e.g. Kafka, GCP PubSub, SNS, SQS).

## Features

* Supports events from [20+ event sources](https://github.com/nholuongut/argo-events/concepts/event_source/)
  and [10+ triggers](https://github.com/nholuongut/argo-events/concepts/trigger/).
* Ability to customize business-level constraint logic for workflow automation.
* Manage everything from simple, linear, real-time to complex, multi-source events.
* [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) compliant.
